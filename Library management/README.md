# -Fake-Library-Management- SQL project- MySQL Workbench
(fake) Library management SQL project

Within this project: 

- 6 Relational tables (5 with Primary + Foreign key restraints)
- 1 Inner joins view
- 1 Stored function 
- ER Diagram showing the relations between all tables
- 1 Stored procedure 

- Additionally, there are also example querys to show how the project runs -  

Note: The stored function within this project doesn't work how it should, but I will fix that at some point when I learn what the issue is...
